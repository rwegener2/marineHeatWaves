# Marine Heatwaves detection code

marineHeatWaves is a module for python which implements the Marine Heatwave (MHW) definition of Hobday et al. (2016). A version written in R is also [available](https://robwschlegel.github.io/heatwaveR/index.html).

# Installation

This module can be installed in one of three ways:
1. Install from PyPI using:
```
pip install marineHeatWaves
```
2. Build from source, downloading the tar.gz file from [the latest release](https://github.com/ecjoliver/marineHeatWaves/releases) on Github: 
  ```
  pip install /path/to/your/file/marineheatwaves-0.0.30.tar.gz
  ```  
3. Alternatively just copy the marineHeatWaves.py to your working directory or any other directory from which Python can import modules.

Prequisite Python modules include numpy, scipy, and datetime.

# Documentation and Usage

|File                      |Description|
|--------------------------|-----------|
|marineHeatWaves_manual.htm|HTML file of IPython notebook outlining use of marineHeatWaves code to detect the "big three" historical marine heatwaves. Original data files (NOAA OI SST hi-res) not supplied due to copyright.|
|example_synthetic.ipynb   |IPython notebook outlining use of marineHeatWaves code to detect events from a synthetic time series. This notebook can be run by the user as it relies only on internally-generated synthetic temperature data.|
|example_synthetic.html    |Static HTML version of example_synthetic.ipynb.|
|mhw_stats.py              |Script with some examples of how to output plots, stats, and data files from marineHeatWaves detection code. Requires a subfolder to be created with the name 'mhw_stats', to which all files are output.|

# Developer Notes

This package is built using setuptools uses `pyproject.toml` as a packaging file. To build a new version of the package use:
```
python -m build
```
Before running ensure a recent version of `build` is installed with `python -m pip install --upgrade build`.
